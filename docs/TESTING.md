# Testing Strategy

## Test layers

### Unit

Domain invariants, unit conversion, transforms, geometry predicates, cutability rules, serialization, and parser behavior.

### Property-based

Round trips, transform inverses, scale invariants, winding/containment rules, idempotent normalization, and serialization determinism.

### Golden fixtures

Reviewed SVG, DXF, trace, and project outputs. Golden changes require an explanation of the geometric difference.

### Integration

Commands, undo/redo, import-preview-commit, export pipelines, project migration, and recovery.

### End-to-end

Launch app, create sign, edit, save, reopen, run cutability, and export at exact size.

## Representative fixtures

Include:

- stencil letters with islands;
- script lettering with thin joins;
- nested contours;
- open and duplicate segments;
- self-intersections;
- inch and millimeter SVGs;
- common DXF 2D entities;
- noisy raster logos;
- high-node-count artwork;
- layered sign with mounting holes.

## Tolerance policy

Tests must identify the tolerance and its reason. Do not use a broad tolerance to hide scale or topology defects.

## Regression policy

Every reproducible bug gets a test at the lowest meaningful layer. UI-only tests are not a substitute for a geometry-unit regression test.
